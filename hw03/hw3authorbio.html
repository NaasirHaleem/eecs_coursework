    <p>Hans Christian Anderson was born in Odense, Denmark in 1805.
      Although he faced a tough educational career, citing cases of abuse
      and ridicule by the faculty of schools that he attended, he went
      on to become one of the most prolific writers of the time. He wrote
      over 3,380 fairy tales. These works have become a mainstay of Western
      literature.</p><br>
